---

The *Molecular Sciences Library* is a fully open-source initiative created **by students, for students** of the CM-USP community.

It started from a simple pain: *books existed, but discovery was hard, circulation was messy, and collective memory was fragile*.

We decided to fix that by building an extensible, transparent and collaborative system that:

* 📖 Catalogs every physical item with structured codes & metadata.
* 🔍 Makes searching intuitive (area, subarea, language, status, availability, lending state).
* 🗂️ Models the **physical arrangement** through a Virtual Bookshelf (digital ↔ real shelves).
* 🔄 Automates loans, renewals, extensions, overdue flows & didactic reservations.
* ✉️ Sends meaningful notifications (borrow, return, renewal, extension, nudges, custom).
* 🏅 Encourages engagement (badges, donor registry, contribution recognition).
* 🌍 Stays totally open: **your pull requests shape the next iteration**.

Created and initially maintained by **Luca Marinho** and **Helena Reis** (Turma 33).
Now, *you*—students, alumni, contributors—are invited to help grow this into a living academic commons.

## 🚀 Quick Start (for the impatient)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucaanasser/MolecularSciencesLibrary.git
cd MolecularSciencesLibrary
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env   # edit as needed
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

## 1. Vision & Philosophy

We believe an academic library is **infrastructure for imagination**.

This project:

* 🎯 Treats operational clarity (statuses, rules, due windows) as UX.
* 🗂️ Sees physical arrangement (shelves) as a navigable data model.
* 🔓 Embraces openness: everything auditable, extensible, remixable.
* ⚡ Prefers *pragmatic simplicity* over premature abstraction.
* 🧪 Welcomes experimentation: modular and replaceable features.

Fork it, extend it, adapt it—**that’s the point**.

* 🟢 Borrow → validate policy, send email.
* 🔄 Renew → enforce max, update due\_date.
* ⏳ Extension → post max renewals only.
* 📬 Nudge → email + optional due\_date shorten.
* ↩️ Return → mark loan + email.
* 🗂️ Virtual Shelf → admin sets ranges, UI highlights.
